## Are-There-Many-Upsets-in-World-Cup

Are there many upsets (weak team beats the strong one) happened in World Cup (2014 &amp; 2018). This article will analyze this question in quantificational way and statistical way. Besides, this essay wants to find if there is any good strategy to make profit in World Cup.

I collected the data of each match in 2014 and 2018 World Cup and its odds of win, draw and lose.(2 matches's data in the group matches of 2014 is missing)  

### Statistical Analysis
The three kinds of results each match are showed below. Statistically speaking, in 2014 and 2018 World Cup, the trends of the result are same. For all the matches, the upset accounts for 25% and in the final round the draw matches are much more than group matches'.

However, it is hard to tell the degree of the upset. Recently, we heard lots of news and we believed the 2018 World Cup had more upset matches. Is it ture? We could use another way to think about it.

### Quantificational Analysis

Assume that we are going to buy the lottery ticket of the soccer and we keep buying the same results: victory, draw or defeat. If the we can make more money in buying the 'weak team beats strong', we can say confidently that there are more upset matches.

1. Use the same capital(10000) in each matches
In the photos, obviously we can see buying 'weak team beats strong team' performs well in 2018(actually the main gain is from Germang losed Mexico and Korea, poor German), hence 2018 world cup may have more upset matches.  
Two interesting things are that keeping buying 'strong team win' could hardly make money, so do you always buy the hot team? Also, we can find in the finals round, there is few upset matches.

2. For the same expectation of each match
Considering another situation, when the match is risky to buy the weak team, which means the odds is really high, we may put less money, and that maybe safer. So we can keep the same expectation. In other words, when the odds rate is 5, we pay 4000 aim to try to get 20000 and when the odds rate is 2, we pay 10000 to try to get 20000. According to the result, 2018 world cup significantly had more upset matches. (Also, this strategy is not a suitable strategy.)

3. Buy draw and defeat to make a 'not win'
Based on former analysis, we find choosing 'strong teams win' could barely make profit, so what about the strong teams not win? In this case, we can buy this team victory and draw at the same time. But the result shows, it is not profitable at all. What a pity!

4. Buy the big upset
What about only buying the big upset? For example, only when the odds rate larger than 6, we buy 'weak team wins'. Here is the result. Actually, it is not profitable either.

#### Conclusion
1. 2018 World Cup has more upset matches.
2. Keep buying hot team can not make profit.
3. There is no sample profitable strategy in World Cup.
4. If you still want to buy the lottery ticket, the strategy that in the group matches buying weak team and in the final mathces buying strong team seems to be a better choice.
5. enjoy soccers, and keep away from gambling
